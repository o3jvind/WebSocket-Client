# WebSocket-Client
An experimental WebSocket client for CasparCG


Put the files in a web server on your machine. And save a rundown from one of the newer official clients from SVT: http://builds.casparcg.com/

Make sure you that you have "Allow Remote Triggering" ticked for the rundown elements in the official client.

Now you can open the rundown and play it out.
