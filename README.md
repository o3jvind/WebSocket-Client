# WebSocket-Client
An experimental WebSocket client for CasparCG


Put the files in a web server on your CasparCG server. And save a rundown as "rundown.xml" in the directory "rundown" from one of the newer official clients from SVT: http://builds.casparcg.com/

Make sure you that you have "Allow Remote Triggering" ticked for the rundown elements you want to be able to control when you save the rundown.

Now you can open the rundown in this client and play it out.
